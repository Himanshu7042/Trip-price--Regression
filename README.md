## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, we delve into the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of the features concerning the target variable (trip price). This involves statistical analysis, visualizations, and identifying any patterns or outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Several features were engineered to enhance the predictive power of the model. For instance, trip time was calculated using the given start and end times. These newly created features contribute to capturing additional insights from the data.

## Data Preprocessing

The data was preprocessed to handle both numerical and string columns efficiently. This involved using pipelines and column transformers to ensure a smooth and standardized preprocessing process.

## Modeling

Various regression models, including bagging and gradient boosting, were employed to predict trip prices. The models were trained on the training dataset, and their performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize the models' performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted. Grid search and cross-validation were employed to find the best hyperparameters for the chosen models.

## Submission on Kaggle

The final models, after hyperparameter tuning, were used to make predictions on the test dataset, and the results were submitted to Kaggle for evaluation. The goal is to achieve the highest accuracy and generalizability on unseen data.
